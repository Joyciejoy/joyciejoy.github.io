When I was little, I would get in trouble for reading so much. I remember locking myself in the bathroom, when I got caught up in a good book, because that was the only room in the house with a lock.</p>\n<p>And I still love to read. I just need to be more conscience of this love and allocate more time to it. And visiting the library is my first step.</p>\n<p>The library has an endless supply of stories, real or imagined, for me to explore, peruse, and experience. As soon as I open the covers of a new book. The journey begins. I become someone new. A doctor, a traveler, a secret service agent. I’m immersed in a world of magic, a world of passion, a world of mystery. I get to meet new friends, strange creatures, and travel to faraway lands. And I get to chase after things that I never would have imagined existed.</p>\n<p>Even though there’s lots of technological gadgets and apps I could use instead of going to a library and checking out a hardcover book, there’s nothing quite like curling up around a physical book. And I’m lucky to have a library where I can do just that. I can slouch down into the cushy oversized bean bags and make a comfortable nest for myself and my book. </p>\n<p>Ugh I could just lay here forever.</p>\n<p>Endless lives to journey.\nEndless possibilities to travel.\nAnd all for free.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Went to the Library","date":"January 18, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/18b48fb71418204eb316b0885f0d5183/90537/WenttotheLibrary_thumbnail_library.jpg","srcSet":"/static/18b48fb71418204eb316b0885f0d5183/467b3/WenttotheLibrary_thumbnail_library.jpg 340w,\n/static/18b48fb71418204eb316b0885f0d5183/e1ddd/WenttotheLibrary_thumbnail_library.jpg 680w,\n/static/18b48fb71418204eb316b0885f0d5183/90537/WenttotheLibrary_thumbnail_library.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Went to The Library/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Did not hit the snooze/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Didn't Hit the Snooze Button"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Took a Day Trip/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Took a Day Trip"}}}}}
