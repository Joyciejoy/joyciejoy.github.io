The music, the lights, the pulsating base, the crowd dancing and singing in sync, and enjoying it all with friends I love.</p>\n<p>I found that concerts and music festivals are a good way for me to stay in touch with my friends. Some friends are in different cities and some are in different states. But music always finds a way for us to stay in touch, come together for a few days or just a long weekend, enjoy some good music, catch up, and let loose. </p>\n<p>I love being immersed by the noise and the crowd. But I like being outside of it too.\\</p>\n<p>At the edge.<br>\nBoth options are open to me.<br>\nTo push in and become one with the masses.<br>\nOr to stay outside and let the music wash over me.\\</p>\n<p>Inside the crowd.<br>\nI feel like a blade of grass.<br>\nLost in a massive meadow.<br>\nAnd the music is like the wind.<br>\nMaking the crow rise and sway to the musician’s whim. </p>\n<p>Outside the crowd I feel like a hovering balloon.<br>\nI can see and observe better.<br>\nI’m still physically part of the party,<br>\nbut it’s easier for me see all the details.</p>\n<p>The brilliance of the lights,<br>\nthe passion of the performers,<br>\nthe enjoyment of the crowd,<br>\nand the appreciation for all the friends that I have beside me. </p>\n<p>Will always have beside me. Even though some of us are far far apart and may not see each other that often. We are all immeasurably connected to one another.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Went to a Concert","date":"January 04, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/43beb74fde7208ce59b715599126c6d8/90537/Wenttoaconcert_thumbnail_tycho.jpg","srcSet":"/static/43beb74fde7208ce59b715599126c6d8/467b3/Wenttoaconcert_thumbnail_tycho.jpg 340w,\n/static/43beb74fde7208ce59b715599126c6d8/e1ddd/Wenttoaconcert_thumbnail_tycho.jpg 680w,\n/static/43beb74fde7208ce59b715599126c6d8/90537/Wenttoaconcert_thumbnail_tycho.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Went to a Concert/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Sent messages of thanks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sent Messages of Thanks"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Did not hit the snooze/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Didn't Hit the Snooze Button"}}}}}
