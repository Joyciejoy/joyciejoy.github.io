I’d be so busy with school, work, friends. And then my tummy would remind me that it was hungry. And it would be a chore. I would have to think of something to eat. Make it or buy it. And then consume it. I didn’t see the enjoyment. Just the time it took to complete the task.</p>\n<p>But all that changed as I got older. And had more discretionary income to spend lol. I’ve been slowly refining my pallet. Growing. Questioning. Why do I crave certain foods and not others. Why do I get tired of eating something but not others.</p>\n<p>Food that tastes different and looks interesting always intrigues me. But food that tastes fun. That evokes a thought. Triggers a memory. Elicite an emotion. At that point, to me, it becomes an art. And after loooots of saving up, and furiously clicking refresh on the reservation site, I was able to experience a delicious adventure at Alinea. </p>\n<p>Why do people spend hundreds of dollars for tiny plates of food? Why do chefs toil away trying to invent or reinvent something we digest? Why is a key piece of each culture centered around the food? Why does sugar filled with helium, bobbing as the waiter brings it to our tables, suddenly change the atmosphere of the whole dining room?</p>\n<p>After eating that balloon. I get it now.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ate a Balloon","date":"November 30, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/8e1b872f810bafb0b627910f4ab7b4d3/90537/AteaBalloon_thumbnail_balloon.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8e1b872f810bafb0b627910f4ab7b4d3/467b3/AteaBalloon_thumbnail_balloon.jpg 340w,\n/static/8e1b872f810bafb0b627910f4ab7b4d3/e1ddd/AteaBalloon_thumbnail_balloon.jpg 680w,\n/static/8e1b872f810bafb0b627910f4ab7b4d3/90537/AteaBalloon_thumbnail_balloon.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Ate a Balloon/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Traveled to a difference city/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traveled to a Different City"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Started the Day with Yoga/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Started the Day With Yoga"}}}}}
