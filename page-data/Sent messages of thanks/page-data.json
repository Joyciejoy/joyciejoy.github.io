But does that really mean anything. How many of those people do I actually talk to? How many of those people do I actually value an opinion from? How many of those people do I want to hear a response from when I’m in need? </p>\n<p>I’m starting to learn that my attention, my care, my love is a limited resource.</p>\n<p>As much as I want to love and get to know and embrace everyone, I mentally and physically cannot.<br>\nI like to see the good in everyone. Everyone has a story. A life they have lived and will live through. And I love to listen. It’s easy for me to put myself in their shoes and understand their logic and actions. Even if I don’t agree, I can listen and empathize and understand. </p>\n<p>I’m also starting to learn that there are people that I sync up well with and people I don’t harmonize as well with.<br>\nAnd that’s okay.<br>\nI’m not cold hearted if I like talking to certain people more than others. I’m not insensitive if I prioritize my time for the people closer to me. I’m not a bitch if I don’t drop everything and listen to people’s issues and concerns right away. </p>\n<p>So.<br>\nTo the friends and family that I turn to when I’m sad or happy.<br>\nTo the people who offer words of advice because they care and it applies to my situation, not just to hear themselves form pretty sounding scentences.<br>\nTo the people that love me even when I’m in my dark moods and am inconsolable.<br>\nTo the people that can’t help but be infected by my bubbly joy on my good days.<br>\nThank you.<br>\nI love you.<br>\nAnd because of you,<br>\nI am learning to love me more.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sent Messages of Thanks","date":"December 28, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/dc0f4513196ff0b33d9a5b4d6e3b7d8b/90537/SentMessagesofThanks_thumbnail_ocean.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dc0f4513196ff0b33d9a5b4d6e3b7d8b/467b3/SentMessagesofThanks_thumbnail_ocean.jpg 340w,\n/static/dc0f4513196ff0b33d9a5b4d6e3b7d8b/e1ddd/SentMessagesofThanks_thumbnail_ocean.jpg 680w,\n/static/dc0f4513196ff0b33d9a5b4d6e3b7d8b/90537/SentMessagesofThanks_thumbnail_ocean.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Sent messages of thanks/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Started the Day with Yoga/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Started the Day With Yoga"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Went to a Concert/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Went to a Concert"}}}}}
