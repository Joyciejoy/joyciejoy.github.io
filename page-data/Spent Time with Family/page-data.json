But also forgetful. </p>\n<p>I’ve forgotten what it’s like to always come home to dinner already on the table.<br>\nI’ve forgotten what it’s like to not have to stress about stains on my clothes because someone else will.<br>\nI’ve forgotten what it’s like to horde small collectables from years and years ago and never throw them out.<br>\nI’ve forgotten about the clutter in the closet that we always said we’d clear out one day, but never did.</p>\n<p>I took time out and enjoyed all of these things today. </p>\n<p>I hung out with childhood friends.<br>\nI flipped through boxes of memories.<br>\nI had grown up conversations with my parents about what their retirement plans.<br>\nI celebrated and ate lots of food with my family.<br>\nAnd I was a mediator between my grandma and my mom. </p>\n<p>Seeing these two strong but so so different personalities clash was an awakening moment for me. My grandma is every cautious. She likes to hold things that are dear to her very close. She prioritizes on saving money, protecting what she has, and living a calm existence. My mom is the opposite. She’s the social butterfly. Flittering between events, friend’s needs, and obligations etc. She never stops and doesn’t want to. She likes to come home for a moment to rest in between flying back out. And although both personalities are fine on their own, it’s when one wants to change the other that hearts get broken.</p>\n<p>I feel I have both of these sides in me. The cautious and languorous side, but also the passionate and insatiable side. And I love both of these sides. I need both in my life. And this allowed me to relate to both my mom and my grandma, and hopefully shed some light on the other’s side for both of them.</p>\n<p>I know that nothing is solved. Never that easy. But I just hope that this visit home, has created a small crack in both of their total rejection of the other’s version of a happy life.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spent Time with Family","date":"February 01, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEBQMG/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdCNfhDYRWxaYekB/8QAHhAAAgEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMEAjM0ABETITH/2gAIAQEAAQUCrB5WeItPrIeWb6jWJWUD3Ex//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAICH/2gAIAQMBAT8Bg//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEgIf/aAAgBAgEBPwGlP//EABkQAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhARIf/aAAgBAQAGPwKvIi8Rp0y//8QAHRABAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIbExgUFhcf/aAAgBAQABPyFjViBpl7it0rmAoXx59QhkDuK1G+dx4Pmoktjc/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABB/wLz/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESD/2gAIAQMBAT8QCMf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIP/aAAgBAgEBPxBYP//EAB8QAAICAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESFBMVFhcYGx0f/aAAgBAQABPxBRJ19E0U2dA9wNNH2yFSWUMCoxupC4oN28hzxPkObWnJChJXVdj//Z","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/bafb8658b88c374005fd13bce50c2c2d/90537/SpentTimewithFamily_thumbnail_inflight.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bafb8658b88c374005fd13bce50c2c2d/467b3/SpentTimewithFamily_thumbnail_inflight.jpg 340w,\n/static/bafb8658b88c374005fd13bce50c2c2d/e1ddd/SpentTimewithFamily_thumbnail_inflight.jpg 680w,\n/static/bafb8658b88c374005fd13bce50c2c2d/90537/SpentTimewithFamily_thumbnail_inflight.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Spent Time with Family/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Took a Day Trip/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Took a Day Trip"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Petsat a Corgi/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pet-sat a Corgi"}}}}}
