The emotion. That I still haven’t fully explored (can anyone really fully explore love?) but I’ve gotten to experience so much of in my life so far.</p>\n<p>I’ve been lucky to have found love in so many places.<br>\nTo have gotten to feel so many different types of love.<br>\nThe confused, butterfly wings, scared, shy, hesitant love<br>\nThe puppy dog eyed, innocent, needy and clingy love<br>\nThe learning to trust, forgetting to breathe, and ignoring advice love<br>\nThe unconventional, controversial, secret love<br>\nThe learning, tearing, screaming at 4 in the morning love<br>\nThe unrequited, never expressed, imaginary, only exists in the dark of night love<br>\nThe mutually beneficial, carefully calculated, realistic, but not quite love<br>\nThe short, summer fling, quick, passionate, fleeting love<br>\nThe friends and family only, unconditional, never wavering love<br>\nThe time tested, soul bearing, heart sharing love<br>\nThe comfortable, fun, easy, fluffy love<br>\nThe unforeseeable, unpreventable, undeniable, challenging, but feels like home love\\</p>\n<p>How can anyone have only one? Would it be better if I’ve only experienced one? The headaches and heart breaks. The learning. The compromises. The 5 hr walks to clear my head. The crying in the rain. The shattering of a heart. The loss of air. The crashing emotions. The panic attacks. The nightmares. The fears. The surprise of finding another soul in this world to inexplicably connect to. The amazing wonder of staring deep into another’s heart and seeing nothing but beauty. The delight of breaking through defenses and getting to hear another life’s story. The overwhelming amount of happiness and sadness I’ve gotten to experience. </p>\n<p>And the insatiable hunger for all the love that’s still to come.</p>\n<p>I would never give any of it up for a clearer world.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Acknowledge How Much I Love Love","date":"February 14, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/cf86ce7295e6a712dbc6f5ba3ee3c3ff/90537/LoveLove_thumbnail_paris.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cf86ce7295e6a712dbc6f5ba3ee3c3ff/467b3/LoveLove_thumbnail_paris.jpg 340w,\n/static/cf86ce7295e6a712dbc6f5ba3ee3c3ff/e1ddd/LoveLove_thumbnail_paris.jpg 680w,\n/static/cf86ce7295e6a712dbc6f5ba3ee3c3ff/90537/LoveLove_thumbnail_paris.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Love Love/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Petsat a Corgi/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pet-sat a Corgi"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Grieving for my Grandma/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Grieving For my Grandma"}}}}}
