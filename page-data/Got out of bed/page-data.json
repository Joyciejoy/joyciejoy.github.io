But some days less gracefully than others. These days, its been increasingly hard.</p>\n<p>But it’s the little steps in the right direction that count right?\n2016 has been a hard year. Death, court documents, overseas complications, flying across the country. And that was just January. As the year went on, it didn’t get better. Good stuff happened too. But hard knocks knocked harder. It doesn’t wait for anyone. And now the grand finale. At least I hope this is it for this year.</p>\n<p>The thing that I keep telling myself is. This is going to be an educational experience. How is a bill passed? How does Congress work? I’m not too sure. Something about 2/3rds?But you can be damn sure I’m gonna find out now.</p>\n<p>I have been apathetic for too long. And the systems I never payed attention to have now thrown out its trump card for me to finally wake the fuck up and say WTF IS HAPPENING?!!?! Fear paralyzes. And I’m tired of being scared. I want to stay clear headed. And caring. And loving. And give conviction to my voice. No matter how small. If a bill passes within the next 4 years. I have hope that it will be one of the best written bills ever. Because it’s going to be put through a microscope by everyone. Not just the educated. Not just the uneducated. Not just the rich. Or the ones in power. Everyone will have their eyes open. I can hope.</p>\n<p>2016 has been a hard year. And it’s not over yet. </p>\n<p>But today I got out of bed. It’s the small things that matter.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Got Out of Bed","date":"November 10, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/729c6dae36bb093a75fe1b1728b6c665/90537/Gotoutofbed_thumbnail_allisbright.jpg","srcSet":"/static/729c6dae36bb093a75fe1b1728b6c665/467b3/Gotoutofbed_thumbnail_allisbright.jpg 340w,\n/static/729c6dae36bb093a75fe1b1728b6c665/e1ddd/Gotoutofbed_thumbnail_allisbright.jpg 680w,\n/static/729c6dae36bb093a75fe1b1728b6c665/90537/Gotoutofbed_thumbnail_allisbright.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Got out of bed/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Played in the grass/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Played in the Grass"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Traveled to a difference city/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traveled to a Different City"}}}}}
