It doesn’t rain here often. And when it does. It doesn’t pour like it does back home. Here the sky feels pent up, strained, threatening to break open. Some raindrops fall, but it never actually achieves that release. That downpour.</p>\n<p>I miss that kind of rain. The pouring kind. The kind that makes windshield wipers useless. The kind that soaks you through and through in the few seconds it takes to run from the car to the front door. The kind that that drowns out the world and washes out all the color. Until everything is that grey grey blue.</p>\n<p>When it’s dark and dreary outside. I like to put on my bright yellow shirt. I love this shirt. It’s so bright that it almost glows. I love the contrast against the deep grey of the sky. </p>\n<p>I am my own sunshine.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Played in the Rain","date":"October 19, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/5ea93f8746e3cafd8a4479d9252f5761/90537/PlayedintheRain_thumbnail_rain.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5ea93f8746e3cafd8a4479d9252f5761/467b3/PlayedintheRain_thumbnail_rain.jpg 340w,\n/static/5ea93f8746e3cafd8a4479d9252f5761/e1ddd/PlayedintheRain_thumbnail_rain.jpg 680w,\n/static/5ea93f8746e3cafd8a4479d9252f5761/90537/PlayedintheRain_thumbnail_rain.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Played in the Rain/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Played in a Playground/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Played in a Playground"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Collected a/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Collected a..."}}}}}
