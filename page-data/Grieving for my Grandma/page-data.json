And I haven’t told many people. I know at times like these I should gather my support system close to me. But I have the opposite desire. I just want to hole away and not talk and not interact with people. Maybe I’m not ready for the sympathy? Or the conversations I will have to have in order for others to comfort me? Maybe I’m just not ready to talk about it? Or maybe that’s just not the way I grieve?</p>\n<p>How do I grieve? By facing it in small doses and writing.</p>\n<p>I’m grieving my grandma. The women who took care of me all my childhood. Who got mad at me for not memorizing my multiplication tables, who tried to teach me algebra in elementary school, who braved world wars, revolutions, and was the first woman in our family to graduate from college annnnnd become a math professor!</p>\n<p>She was the stingiest &#x26; most giving person in my life. She could haggle with the fruit man until he threw up his hands in surrender and gave us the watermelon for much cheaper than posted, offered to carry it for us to our apartment complex, and then stayed to eat a slice because grandma would insist that he eat and hydrate himself before leaving lol.</p>\n<p>From her, I learned the worth of being responsible. To myself, to others, and to the world around me. I remember when I lost my keys. I knew I would get in trouble and get lectured by my grandma and my mom. But I also had to learn how much of an effect it had on the world around me. We would need to get the locks changed. We would need to get new keys. We would need to develop a better procedure or process to reduce the risk of me losing my keys again. Each of these steps took time and attention. And those are limited resources that isn’t to be squandered. That’s what it was like with my grandma, nothing was squandered.</p>\n<p>I wish I could control grief. I understand I need time to grieve and that there’s not set course to follow as everyone’s grieving process is unique. But that’s what makes it so frustrating. It isn’t predictable, it isn’t reasonable, it isn’t planned, and it isn’t controllable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Grieving For my Grandma","date":"October 19, 2018","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/d6d02ff2c3586e4ff0dc96e437c332c9/90537/MAD_thumbnails_grievingmygrandma.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d6d02ff2c3586e4ff0dc96e437c332c9/467b3/MAD_thumbnails_grievingmygrandma.jpg 340w,\n/static/d6d02ff2c3586e4ff0dc96e437c332c9/e1ddd/MAD_thumbnails_grievingmygrandma.jpg 680w,\n/static/d6d02ff2c3586e4ff0dc96e437c332c9/90537/MAD_thumbnails_grievingmygrandma.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Grieving for my Grandma/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Love Love/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Acknowledge How Much I Love Love"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Good Morning Future Me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Good Morning Future Me <3"}}}}}
