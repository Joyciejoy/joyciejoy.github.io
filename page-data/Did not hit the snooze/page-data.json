I wake up to my alarm, I hit snooze, I go back to sleep, I wake up 9 minutes later, and I’m even sleepier. Can’t win.</p>\n<p>But when I was jet lagged from my overseas trip recently, I would fall asleep around 8 and wake up at 2 in the morning, totally wide awake. Even though I only got 6 hours of sleep. I felt fully rested and ready to tackle the day. </p>\n<p>As I slowly settled back into my routine and my jet lag went away, I started waking up more and more tired. Even if I increased the number of hours I slept. 8, 10, 12 hours, it didn’t matter. I was still sleepy! It was like I could never get enough sleep.</p>\n<p>So I’m gonna try out this trick: don’t hit my snooze button. Waking up when the alarm rings the first time can be hard. My body at rest likes to stay at rest. But hitting the snooze and waking up 9 minutes later is even more disruptive. Because I fall back into deep sleep.<br>\nMy brain: I hit snooze, we good, we’re going back to sleep!<br>\nBody: yasssssssss<br>\n9 minutes later<br>\nAlarm: BEEEH BEEEH BEEEH BEEEH BEEEH<br>\nBody: BETRAYAL!!!</p>\n<p>And thats my theory of why I wake up the 2nd time more sleepy than if I had just gotten up the 1st time. Because my body doesn’t understand “extra 9 minutes” it just feels angry and betrayed that we’re not finishing another full sleep cycle. I have no idea about the science and what-nots about this. All I know is this morning I didn’t hit snooze. I slowly stretched, breathed deep, and blinked open my eyes. I got out of bed 5 minutes after I woke up. And I felt good and awake and ready to face the day. </p>\n<p>Going to try it again tomorrow. Hope it works!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Didn't Hit the Snooze Button","date":"January 11, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/e60a8dbe4946347fb5e26f4b259fa885/90537/Didnthitsnooze_thumbnail_chicago.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e60a8dbe4946347fb5e26f4b259fa885/467b3/Didnthitsnooze_thumbnail_chicago.jpg 340w,\n/static/e60a8dbe4946347fb5e26f4b259fa885/e1ddd/Didnthitsnooze_thumbnail_chicago.jpg 680w,\n/static/e60a8dbe4946347fb5e26f4b259fa885/90537/Didnthitsnooze_thumbnail_chicago.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Did not hit the snooze/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Went to a Concert/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Went to a Concert"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Went to The Library/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Went to the Library"}}}}}
