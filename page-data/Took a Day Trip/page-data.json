It’s a great way to fall in love with a city. </p>\n<p>This wasn’t my first time here. So I already got all the tourist hot spots out of the way. But we went to some familiar sights again. Places that I have already gone to and know I loved. But then we strayed around the area. Away from the Yelp community approved places. Into the nooks and crannies and hidden rooftop alcoves. Walking into art galleries I normally would have drove past. Playing in playgrounds I normally would have observed from afar. Reading plaques, browsing books, and sampling coffee from independent roasters that I never even knew existed.</p>\n<p>Of course, I’m still going to make spreadsheets for my big trips. But remembering to leave ample space to wander and meander between the marked attractions on my map, I wonder what hidden gems I’ll stumble upon on my next trip.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Took a Day Trip","date":"January 25, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/2a4ccab37fc6db28080af96105987866/90537/TookaDayTrip_thumbnail_bee.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2a4ccab37fc6db28080af96105987866/467b3/TookaDayTrip_thumbnail_bee.jpg 340w,\n/static/2a4ccab37fc6db28080af96105987866/e1ddd/TookaDayTrip_thumbnail_bee.jpg 680w,\n/static/2a4ccab37fc6db28080af96105987866/90537/TookaDayTrip_thumbnail_bee.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Took a Day Trip/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Went to The Library/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Went to the Library"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Spent Time with Family/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spent Time with Family"}}}}}
