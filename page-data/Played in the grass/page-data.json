Barefoot.</p>\n<p>Yes yes, I know the grass was probably really dirty. But it’s okay! I didn’t have any open wounds and I washed my feet after :D</p>\n<p>Wow. When was the last time I touched grass with my bare feet? I honestly don’t remember. The cold droplets of dew between my toes. The feel of the blades tickling my soles. The softness of the earth.</p>\n<p>I wish I had a yard or a garden or my own patch of clean grass so I could do this more often. Cuz I have no idea how many dogs have peed on this grass lol. </p>\n<p>But you know what? It still felt good. To kick off my shoes and feel the ground beneath me. Let the my toes wiggle freely. And not worry about cleanliness and grass stains and everything else that life has told me I should consider before doing something so simple. </p>\n<p>So many thoughts to analyze. All the precautions and mental red flags I have to rationalize. Just to touch grass with my bare feet. </p>\n<p>When did life get so complicated?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Played in the Grass","date":"November 02, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/98155b4daf8998dd59329028e00ee8d6/90537/PlayedInTheGrass_thumbnail_grass.jpg","srcSet":"/static/98155b4daf8998dd59329028e00ee8d6/467b3/PlayedInTheGrass_thumbnail_grass.jpg 340w,\n/static/98155b4daf8998dd59329028e00ee8d6/e1ddd/PlayedInTheGrass_thumbnail_grass.jpg 680w,\n/static/98155b4daf8998dd59329028e00ee8d6/90537/PlayedInTheGrass_thumbnail_grass.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Played in the grass/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Collected a/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Collected a..."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Got out of bed/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Got Out of Bed"}}}}}
