It’s not a seashell, not a sand dollar…a sea urchin says the internet. It’s beautiful.</p>\n<p>I used to collect something from the beach every time I went to the ocean. I had jars of them, seashells, dried starfish, smooth stones that have been washed up from who knows how far by waves for who knows how long. And I displayed them in my room. I don’t visit the ocean as often now. And when I do, I don’t scour the beach for the perfect seashell to take home anymore. </p>\n<p>I’m not sure why? What changed? Fear of being judged by my friends? Too lazy to keep the shell safe until I get home? Just not as amazed by their opalescent colors as much?</p>\n<p>Or maybe I’ve learned to appreciate them without the need to posses them. They are still beautiful. I’m still enthralled by all the colors that glitter in the sunlight. And I still listen for the waves inside the conch shells. But I no longer need to take them home. This beauty shouldn’t be mine alone to enjoy. </p>\n<p>I placed the shell back on the beach. Maybe someone will come and see it and be just as amazed as I am. Maybe it’ll be crushed by a dog running past and not noticing. Maybe the waves will take it back for more adventures. </p>\n<p>I’m just glad I was able to witness it’s existence.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Collected a...","date":"October 26, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/bb5d41017641c5aa580da212e735fb90/90537/Collecteda_thumbnail_seaurchin.jpg","srcSet":"/static/bb5d41017641c5aa580da212e735fb90/467b3/Collecteda_thumbnail_seaurchin.jpg 340w,\n/static/bb5d41017641c5aa580da212e735fb90/e1ddd/Collecteda_thumbnail_seaurchin.jpg 680w,\n/static/bb5d41017641c5aa580da212e735fb90/90537/Collecteda_thumbnail_seaurchin.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Collected a/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Played in the Rain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Played in the Rain"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Played in the grass/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Played in the Grass"}}}}}
