A lush bath. With a Lush bath bomb. The world‚Äôs smallest disco. ‚ÄòTis a celebration after all.</p>\n<p>Bathtub cleaned, water started. I gathered snacks, drinks, electronic device for entertainment, and placed them on the bath-side table (yup, like a bedside table, but bath side üòÅ). Checked the water level, the temperature, everything else is within reach but safe from falling in.\nPerfect. Time to get in &#x26; drop in my bath bomb üëèüéâüõÄüíñ</p>\n<p>Soft splash as the bath bomb entered the water.</p>\n<p>Black immediately begin to swirl off and spread across the water‚Äôs surface. Bubbles fizzle out of the bath bomb in all directions. Making it twist and turn and bubble and brew. Yellow! a dot of yellow detaches from the ball and streaks, like a shooting star across the black water. Blue! shoots in a different direction. Green! Pink! Another yellow! Orange!! All the while, black spreads steadily. Permeating the whole tub. Making the colors that much more brilliant, the water that much more mysterious.</p>\n<p>This bath bomb was not what I expecting. Yes, I saw the main color was black while I was buying it, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to make the water this intensely black. I couldn‚Äôt see beyond a centimeter under the surface. I lowered my self down into the blackness. Up to my nose. Completely engulfed. The dark waters invited deep thoughts. Thoughts I haven‚Äôt visited because of fear? lack of time? discomfort? The warmth invited me to relax as I gathered the courage to face these thoughts. The soft music I chose invited me to not rush, permission to slow down. I gifted myself time. To work through the thoughts I needed to work through. To get bored with that and switch to watching a comedy on my iPad. To get distracted and forget myself in someone else‚Äôs story. And to come back to myself for resolution and compassion and appreciation.</p>\n<p>As I watched the black water swirl down the drain. I felt lighter. I had released some of my stress into the water. I didn‚Äôt need it anymore. I acknowledged their purpose, I appreciated their existence, and then I bid them farewell.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Happy Lunar New Year!","date":"February 17, 2019","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/b36459183d6e691b51c2183404087446/90537/MAD_thumbnail_happylunarnewyear.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b36459183d6e691b51c2183404087446/467b3/MAD_thumbnail_happylunarnewyear.jpg 340w,\n/static/b36459183d6e691b51c2183404087446/e1ddd/MAD_thumbnail_happylunarnewyear.jpg 680w,\n/static/b36459183d6e691b51c2183404087446/90537/MAD_thumbnail_happylunarnewyear.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Happy Lunar New Year/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Good Morning Future Me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Good Morning Future Me <3"}},"next":null}}}
