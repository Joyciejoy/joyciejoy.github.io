Well, I had to share him with my boyfriend and it was just for the weekend. My boyfriend and I are planning to get a baby corgi soon and have already begun researching the breed. But no amount of research beats meeting and getting to spend time with a corgi ourselves. And this proved to be a great window into what our lives with a corgi would be like. And I loved it!!</p>\n<p>It wasn’t a walk in the park. The corgi was young enough to still be impressionable and ecstatically curious about everything. But he was big enough to answer when called and was a force to be reckoned with when he wants to get somewhere NOW!</p>\n<p>But I think we handled ourselves beautifully in the short time that we got to have him. We were strict with his peeing and eating schedule. We took him to the dog park and carefully monitored him to make sure he was playing well with all the dogs and was never in danger. We noticed that it was in his nature to be attracted to certain dogs over others, and found that fascinating.</p>\n<p>But we did get to walk in the park. And after familiarizing himself with his surroundings, and making sure he felt safe, he was the perfect gentleman to grabby babies and bounding squirrels and other dogs.</p>\n<p>And I learned the importance of asking the owner for permission before petting their dogs. It was very surprising how many people would just approach and pet him without asking me first. The corgi didn’t care, but I had a slight existential freak out every time!</p>\n<p>“Hello! I am here! I am the mock owner of this dog and I would like my existence to be acknowledged!!”</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pet-sat a Corgi","date":"February 08, 2017","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/2f91ffc0d1a443a455c74b2d9bb3b398/90537/PetsataCorgi_thumbnail_gatsby.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2f91ffc0d1a443a455c74b2d9bb3b398/467b3/PetsataCorgi_thumbnail_gatsby.jpg 340w,\n/static/2f91ffc0d1a443a455c74b2d9bb3b398/e1ddd/PetsataCorgi_thumbnail_gatsby.jpg 680w,\n/static/2f91ffc0d1a443a455c74b2d9bb3b398/90537/PetsataCorgi_thumbnail_gatsby.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Petsat a Corgi/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Spent Time with Family/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spent Time with Family"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Love Love/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Acknowledge How Much I Love Love"}}}}}
