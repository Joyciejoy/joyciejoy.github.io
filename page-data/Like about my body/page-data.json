A whole list of items come flying into mind. But when I asked myself, what’s my favorite part of my body, I could hear the silence and hesitation. </p>\n<p>Favorite part. Hmmmm… Today, I chose. I blocked out all the negatives and focused on the positives. And so many parts began to shine. My hair. My right eye. The shape of my pinky toenail. But my most favorite, are my wrists.</p>\n<p>My wrists. It’s such a small part of my body. So delicate. Intricate. Easily hurt or sprained. I had an active childhood and I’ve sprained both at the same time and had to have surgery to fix them. Definitely learned their importance the hard way lol. Even now, when I try to do a cartwheel or a handstand, I can only put so much pressure on my hands before my wrists say “no no”. But that just makes me love my wrists more. Because they’re not perfect. And I have the battle scars to prove it. They have character. A story. And they’re not ornamental. They are a fundamental part of my everyday life. And yet they only represent such a tiny part of me.</p>\n<p>If I can find beauty and love in something so small. Then I should be able to learn to appreciate the rest of me just as much. </p>\n<p>Over time.<br>\nBaby steps.<br>\nOne action at a time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What Do I Not Like About My Body","date":"October 04, 2016","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/d83e157ea16c8fc87d0f1abed71b20c6/90537/Notlikeaboutmybody_thumbnail_wrists.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d83e157ea16c8fc87d0f1abed71b20c6/467b3/Notlikeaboutmybody_thumbnail_wrists.jpg 340w,\n/static/d83e157ea16c8fc87d0f1abed71b20c6/e1ddd/Notlikeaboutmybody_thumbnail_wrists.jpg 680w,\n/static/d83e157ea16c8fc87d0f1abed71b20c6/90537/Notlikeaboutmybody_thumbnail_wrists.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Like about my body/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Take the Scenic Route/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Take the Scenic Route Home"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Listened to My Favorite Song/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Listened to My Favorite Song"}}}}}
